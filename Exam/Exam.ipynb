    "## My Preferred Programming Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve my best work in **Programming**, I have found that establishing the right physical and digital environment is essential. I prefer working in a quiet space with natural lighting, though I often switch my code editor to *Dark Mode* to reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools and Setup\n",
    "My workflow relies heavily on a specific set of tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **VS Code:** I use this for its robust extension ecosystem.\n",
    "* **Dual Monitors:** Having code on one screen and documentation on the other increases my efficiency.\n",
    "* **Git Bash:** I prefer command-line interfaces for version control over GUIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I encounter a difficult bug, I find that stepping away from the screen for a few minutes helps clear my mind, allowing me to return with a fresh perspective."
