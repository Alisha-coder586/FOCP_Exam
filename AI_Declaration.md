# AI Declaration

## Overview

In the spirit of transparency and academic integrity, I declare that Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were utilized during the development of this project. Their use was limited to educational support and technical assistance as detailed below.

## Tools Used

- **Gemini** (Google)
- [Optional: Add other tools if used, e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot]

## Scope of AI Usage

AI tools were used strictly for the following purposes:

### 1. Concept Exploration & Knowledge Acquisition

- AI was used to summarize and explain complex programming concepts relevant to the project.
- It served as an interactive documentation reference to clarify syntax and library functions.

### 2. Debugging & Error Resolution

- AI assisted in interpreting error messages (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `SystemExit`) and identifying the root causes of bugs.
- It provided suggestions for fixing specific logic errors within code blocks.

## Human Verification

- All code suggestions provided by AI were reviewed, understood, and manually tested before integration.
- The core logic, project structure, and final implementation decisions are the work of the repository owner.
- No code was copied blindly without a full understanding of its functionality.

_This declaration confirms that while AI was used as a tool for assistance, the project represents the work and understanding of the author._
